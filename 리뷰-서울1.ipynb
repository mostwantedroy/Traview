degree vies of seoul.best time to visit is afternoon until night to see the lights at night', \"The Korean Drama that left the biggest impact on Namsam Tower to me is Legend of the Blue Sea! If you're a fan like me, don't miss this!\\n\\nRemember the scene when Sim Cheong told Heo Joon Jae to meet at Namsam Tower on the next first snow? She walked up the hill and he drove up but she got into an accident and didn't make it to the top. You definitely don't want to miss Heo Joon Jae. So let me share with you a tip: How to get to N Seoul Tower!\\n\\nSearch on Kakao Map/Google Map: Namsan Ormi Elevator (Bottom Entrance) in my opinion this is the easiest way to get up! The Elevator is like a tram train, you'll be able to enjoy the surrounding view on your way up. Then follow the crowd and you'll get to N Seoul Tower!\\n\\nWhen leaving N Seoul Tower back to the city, i recommend to catch a bus to the nearest station depending on your next destination. The bus stop is just a stone throw away by walking down a short slope, do look out for bus stop signs :)\", 'I went to Namsan on my first day at Seoul. I went there at golden hour to catch winter sun set. Seeing Seoul from top, bathed in golden sun rays, it was really worthy went all the way to Namsan Tower against breezing wind winter. A cup of hot chocolate was enough to keep me warm during my visit.', 'If your in Seoul you should visit the N Tower. The view is very fantastic, you can see the city lights on the top, its nice to visit during evening. They also have restaurant there in case your hungry and you want to enjoy the view while eating.', 'The N Seoul Tower is relatively easy to get to by train/bus. You can take a special bus to the top of the hill or you can hike it up the hill which is a very good workout. Go to the tower in the evening as the view of the city is fantastic. There is also a couple of gift shops to purchase your souvenirs. A must see while in Seoul. Take the tram ride up to the elevator, at the base of the tower, if you’re not up to the hike.', 'Well worth the time and it offers a great view of the city. There is plenty of merch to buy, and of you get hungry there see restaurants here as well. Of you visit during winter you should dress warm since it could get pretty windy up here.\\n\\nIt is easy to get here by bus and the entrence fee is pretty cheap.', 'The day we arrived in Seoul, after putting our luggage at the hotel, we straight away took a bus to Namsan Tower. I booked the ticket using Klook and scanned the ticket at the entrance. The view at night is amazing you can see the whole area. If you have strong legs, you can walk up the hill.', 'Located in a relatively central location in Seoul,no direct metro but can easily navigate your way there by alighting at Dongguk University stn, exit 6 n go to bus stop near Uni bridge. Take bus 2 n 4 to reach. Tower located at Namsan Mountain whereby one can take many nice photos. Tower visit itself is rather optional as the mountain already provide a fantastic view of the city. Defo worth a visit.', \"I purchased the Skip the Line ticket, but for the time I actually went (during the day, middle of the week, January), I didn't need it (however, it seems like from other reviews, you may still want to consider it). I took the Hop On Hop Off Bus - Palace Route to get to the tower. It's still quite a hike up the hill, but the sun was out and the views of Seoul were really incredible. I feel very lucky that the weather cooperated and while there was some glare through the windows and a bit of haze, I think my photos came out okay and I had a good time just walking around the floor, looking at different points around the city. There is helpful signage with the distance of different cities from Seoul. There is a small gift shop where you can buy postcards and even mail them. There is a sit down restaurant, but I believe you need to have reservations. Once you get out of the tower, there are other restaurants and souvenir shops. I wish I would have taken the cable car, that sounds like it was fun.\", 'I didn’t go to the zoo nor Seoul Land at the Park - both of which looked depressingly lonely; however I did enjoy a nice walk around the park grounds. There were a lot of people having picnics, walking around. The flower Garden was closed but I still managed to find some flowers around the gate. We took the elephant train 3 times, had a ticket for the forth time as well but we decided to walk. It was a nice walk and nice to see peaceful nature in proximity.', 'The sky lift over the lake at this season - no flowers, no snow - alone was worth the visit. The lake was frozen at the edges. The calmness and reflections were peaceful. We bought a package ticket. However, it only included one ride (between the zoo and the zoo entrance or between the zoo entrance and the main entrance). Would recommend to save th the ticket for the latter ride.\\n\\nThe zoo was bigger than imagined. There was a good variety of animals, and more than 6 tigers. The living conditions of some animals were not as satisfactory.', 'The Seoul Grand Park has a good zoo and rose garden. I did not see roses in past visits but this time (late Oct.) the rose garden was filled with roses. In autumn the autumn colours are fascinating. However this year was dry and the summer was unusually long so the ginkgo and maple trees were much less attractive than last year. I like the park because it has a bird house where one could see various birds face to face ie not caged. The zoo is very large and has a wide range of animals.', 'The zoo is big and nice, better you buy the package ticket wich incl elephant tram and sky lift. The only minus thing is there is not much option for food. Mostly sell sausage, teokkebi, and other korean food. So, if you want to eat other cuisine, bring it from home/ buy it before get in to the zoo. Oh, there is also 1 kfc outlet wich always full and dunkin doughnut before the ticket counter.', 'We went there to visit the Zoo, we ended up visiting the whole place and spend the whole day there. The zoo is big and there is a lot to see. There is a sky lift that goes over a huge distance with amazing views. We did not expect something so nice - we were also lucky to go there in autumn when all the leaves were changing and the views were incredible. Definitely go even just for the sky lift ride - it was amazing!', 'To access this area I would recommend using the lift as it provides an aerial view of the zoo. Within the zoo there are many animals on display from giraffes, elephant, lion, etc. The zoo is well- kept and the grounds are so pleasant to walk through. There are even some activity areas such as a rock wall and elephant trunk slide.', 'We drove. Traffic was pretty backed up getting to and from the parking lot and Waze was directing us away from the parking we needed, beyond the \"Seoul Zoo\" parking sign, so we ignored Waze. We were able to pay for parking using our debit card, didn\\'t need a Korean bank card or won. 5,000 won for a smaller vehicle and 10,000 won for a larger. From the parking lot, follow the crowds to get tickets for the Elephant Tram or walk 1km to the main entrance of the zoo. At the zoo entrance, buy tickets to enter the zoo. There are stroller rentals available, we were also able to use our debit card for this. 3,000 won, but had to leave ID there until we returned. Strollers were nice. The zoo grounds are beautiful. It was hot out, but I bet a trip in the fall would have been perfect. I was expecting to see a lot of sad exhibits based on other comments, but they seemed pretty typical compared to any other zoo I\\'ve been to. I thought the spacing was good and yes, there\\'s a lot of walking, but it didn\\'t feel like too much. My kids had a lot of fun. I thought the food/drink choices were good, too. You can also bring your own food and drink in if you wanted. When leaving, you have to buy a return trip for the Elephant Tram or make the 1 km trek back to the parking area (which is also the same as the entrance to the subway)... I recommend going, especially if you have kids! It was fun!', \"Easter weekend travel to Seoul Korea and we knew we would have to visit the Seoul Zoo during April, my daughter loves animals and zoo's, we came here in Dec 2018 and it was too cold and the animals were all housed inside so it wasnt fun last time but this time it was amazing.\\n\\nThe weather was very nice, sunny and cool, no icy floor, the cherry blossoms were still in effect so lots of people were still taking pictures, all the animals were out and about instead of locked in large rooms.\\n\\nKids get in free so when we went there was many school children which was very nice to see them enjoy the park.\", 'The park has been one of my favorites in Seoul. It had been under renovation for many months but fortunately the renovation was completed when I went there in early Nov., 2018. The aviary was extensively altered. Now the visitors are isolated from the birds by glass panels. However some new species have been added. I like to go there in late Oct. or early Nov. as the maples and ginkgo trees create a beautiful mix of red, orange and yellow colors. The park is very large and I like the zoo most. To save walking, it is better to take the chair lift to the top and then walk down the hill. Once back to the zoo entrance I usually take the chair lift back to the main entrance, around sunset time. The view (from the chair lift) of the lake at sunset is fascinating.', 'I love visiting zoo’s and seeing different animals. However, I recommend not visiting this zoo. I travelled 1.5 hours to get here, and I feel like my time travelling and visiting was wasted. There were many different animals, which was probably the best point. Each enclosure was small, dirty, and there was no sign of a zookeeper anywhere. Usually on my visits to the zoo I see many zookeepers tending and feeding the animals, but during my visit here I didn’t see any. Many animals looked sad and hungry, often eating dry leaves. The monkeys were also acting out at each other, probably because the cages were so small. As I mentioned, I love to visit the zoo, just not this one.']\n","['105, Namsangongwon-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04340 South Korea', '105, Namsangongwon-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04340 South Korea', '102,
